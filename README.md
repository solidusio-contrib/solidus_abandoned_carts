SpreeAbandonedCarts
===================

Take some action for abandoned carts.

Override `Spree::Order#abandoned_cart_actions` with your logic.
By default an email is sent, see `AbandonedCartMailer`.

You have to trigger the method in some way, an example recurring Sidekiq worker
is included.

Installation
------------

Add spree_abandoned_carts to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_abandoned_carts', github: 'freego/spree_abandoned_carts', branch: 'X-X-stable'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_abandoned_carts:install
```

Usage
-----
There are some preferences you can change (defaults are shown here):

```ruby
SpreeAbandonedCarts::Config.tap do |config|
  # order states to check for abandonment
  config.abandoned_states = [:cart, :address, :delivery, :payment, :confirm]
  # when an order can be marked as abandoned
  config.abandoned_after_minutes = 1440 # 24 hours
  # how often the sidekiq worker should run
  config.worker_frequency_minutes = 30
end
```

To modify the email, you just have to override `Spree.t(:abandoned_cart_subject)`
and `app/views/spree/abandoned_cart_mailer/abandoned_cart_email.html.erb`.


Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_abandoned_carts/factories'
```
